About this dataset
Looking to better understand how energy is used in the home? This dataset can help. It contains six months of electricity consumption data for a household, gathered between January 2007 and June 2007. The data includes information on global active power, global reactive power, voltage, global intensity, sub-metering 1 (kitchen), sub-metering 2 (laundry room), and sub-metering 3 (electric water heater and air conditioner). With 260,640 measurements in total, this dataset can provide crucial insights into understanding household electricity consumption

How to use the dataset
This dataset can be used for machine learning purposes such as predictive modeling or time series analysis. For example, one could use this dataset to predict future household electricity consumption based on past data.

Some possible research ideas include:

Analyzing the effects of different types of electrical devices on power consumption
Studying how power consumption changes over time and by location
Constructing a predictive model to forecast future power consumption
